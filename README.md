# Why React?
I have chosen React, because:
- I have already used it
- I like the declarative paradigm of React 
- React got a big community
- React is famous
- React IS JS

# Why this structure
Architecture of react project general:
- src/  
  - assets/
    - jss/
       - components/
          - fictionalComponentStyle.js
          - etc ....
       - views/
          - fictionalViewStyle.js
          - etc ....
     - images/
        - some_images
   - components/
      - fictionalComponent/
        - FictionalComponent.js
      - templateLayout/
        - TemplateLayout.js
      - etc ...
      - index.js
    - views/
      - fictionalViews/
        - Section/
          - component_which_only_belong_to_this_view
        - index.js
      - etc..
      - index.js
    - plugin/
      - config/
      - yup
      - etc ...
    - store/
      - reducers/
      - action/
    - service/
      - someCall
    - App.js
    - index.js
    
I PUT SOME index to make cleaner my import.
I often create a template for my view.
I often didn't put prop type because I didn't take time to put it.
I differentiate my views from my components, because components create views. In this app, i was pretty rough, i directly put my code in the main layout, SORRY.

# Why ccs in js?
I prefer the js way because:
 - i keep using js
 - i can not make mistake about my stylefile (take the wrong file)

# What are the differents points to improve according to me ?
I have to:
- refactor the code
- add more breakpoint to have better responsiveness
- proptype my components more
- give defaultprops for my components more
- think differently for the sorting algorithm (pretty rough)
- make good import with index
- improve UI (better style)
- use more jest fonctionnality
- use some event

# Why Material UI?
I have already used it.
It pretty good all of their components are linked so can customized the root of the style, then all componenents change (pretty cool).
Good doc.

# Why Jest?
It was recommanded, i have already used it. Good doc.

# How to launch ?
you must install first: node and npm


then you can launch in your terminal: npx create-react-app my-app


this command will install all you need to start your project.
if i you want more explanation:
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

when you have finished. You must enter in your folder my-app.
then you must install some packages because i used some.

You must run:
  - npm install formik (to make form)                            NOT IN THE PROJECT
  - npm install yup (validation form)                            NOT ...........
  - npm install @material-ui/core (ui)                           IN.................
  - npm install @material-ui/icons (ui)                          IN.....................
  - npm install redux (general store)                            IN..............
  - npm install react-redux (general store)                      IN...................
  - npm install redux-thunk (to make some asynchronous storage)  IN...........
  - npm install redux-saga (to make some asynchronous storage)   IN...............
  - npm install axios (make some call)                           NOT IN ..........................
  - npm i @crello/react-lottie (animation for lottie)            IN .................
  - npm i @testing-library/react (test)                          IN ..................
  - npm i react-test-renderer  (test)                            IN.........................
  - npm i jest-dom   (test)                                      IN..............
  
Whe it is done, you run: 
 - npm audit fix
 - npm start
 
 # Testing part
 run: npm test
 
 
 I just create a little component to show you what unit testing look like,
 I could :
 - use more jest fonctionnality
 - use some event
 - ....
